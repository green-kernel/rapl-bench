This data was collected on 9 X260 machines of the same model. 
The room was not temperature controlled.

On each machine ID we collected the MSR update using the c-file as follows:
1. we executed the collector script (this was done by hand and the amount of observations differ) and >> the content into a file names "out_"+ID+"_no_load.csv". We stopped the measurements using ctrl+c
2. we started the stress-command "stress -ng -c 1" and afterwards, I started the collector script. 

There are many sources for variations:
procedure:
- difference in sampling time => large differences in number of samples per computer
- difference in time between the stress-command and the collector command

environment:
- difference in CPU load for "0" load
- temperature is not controlled and not logged

Suggested Improvements for the collector script: 
- when a usec increase, the time_diff is a negative number
- add logging of CPU temperature (mainly for verification reasons). If this affects the update rate, we can log when start+end collection
- add logging of CPU utilization to verify the actual utilization
- add logging of current frequency 
- create a wrapper script for starting+ending sampling to ensure , controlling CPU loads,
